# Python Selenium Test Automation Framework

This is a personal project where I am building a custom test automation framework using **Python**, **Selenium**, and **pytest**.  
The goal of this framework is to practice test automation concepts and to have a base structure for UI test automation projects 
as well as for backend testing.

## Features
- Built with **Python 3** and **Selenium WebDriver**
- Uses **pytest** as the test runner
- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- API test support using **Python requests** module
- Automatic screenshot capture on test failure
- Easy to integrate with **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
